# Blackjack Game üÉè

A simple console-based Blackjack game implemented in Python. This game allows you to play against the computer, dealing cards, calculating scores, and determining the winner based on the rules of Blackjack.

## Features

- **Card Dealing**: Randomly deals cards to the player and the computer.
- **Score Calculation**: Calculates scores with special handling for Blackjack and busts.
- **Game Flow**: Allows the player to draw additional cards or pass, while the computer plays according to standard Blackjack rules.
- **Game Outcome**: Determines the result of the game (win, loss, or draw) based on the final scores.

## How It Works

1. **Initial Deal**: The player and the computer are each dealt two cards.
2. **Player Turn**: The player is prompted to either draw another card or pass. The game ends if the player gets a Blackjack or busts (score over 21).
3. **Computer Turn**: The computer draws cards until its score is 17 or higher.
4. **Determine Winner**: The scores are compared to declare the winner, with special rules for Blackjack.
